Containerization with docker

What I have understood from this project
1]In MLOPS or any other production grade application, it is important to name each file properly and 
write seperate functions in diffrent files so as to debug easily.
2]The main thing in a production application is to track the steps,
experiments and write proper raise error statements to debug easily.
3]Pipelines are the main part of MLOPS Devops operations. They consist off different funcctions called steps to achheive a common goal.
4]For MLOPS project it is important to expose fast apis so as to use it where we can.
5]Docker will containerize the application.That means it isolate the program ad store it in an image and using this image we can run this program
6]I have also understood logistic Regresiion and how to read its results.
7]Ilearnt how to regisster mlflow and
